### Project Overview

 In this We have done below task,
1)function called palindrome(num) that given a number 'num', finds the next smallest palindrome and returns it
2)function called 'a_scramble(str_1, str_2)' that given the strings'str_1','str_2' returns True if a portion of 'str_1' characters can be scrambled to match 'str2', else return False
3)function called check_fib(num) that checks if the given number 'num' is part of the fibonacci sequence and returns True if it is, else False
4)function compress(word) that given a word word returns the string with it's letters and how many times they occur continously together.
5) function k_distinct(string,k) that given a string 'string' and number 'k', it checks whether the 'string' has 'k' distinct characters


### Learnings from the project

 From this i have learned the list, Loop, while loop and set in detailed manner with string operations
